## Setup Instructions
### Using Docker (Recommended)
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
This will start both the MySQL database and the Spring Boot application.
### Manual Setup
1. Ensure you have Java 23 and Maven installed
2. Clone the repository
3. Run:
```bash
mvn clean install
mvn run
```
## Database Configuration

The application uses MySQL as its database. You can configure the database connection in the `application.properties` file:

```properties
# Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://[DATABASE_HOST]:[PORT]/[DATABASE_NAME]
spring.datasource.username=[USERNAME]
spring.datasource.password=[PASSWORD]
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
```

### Configuration Options:

1. **Local Development**:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/tune-tracker-db
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
   ```

2. **Cloud Deployment (AWS RDS example)**:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://your-instance.region.rds.amazonaws.com:3306/tune-tracker-db
   spring.datasource.username=dbuser
   spring.datasource.password=dbpassword
   ```

### Security Best Practices:

- Never commit your actual database credentials to version control
- Use environment variables or a secure vault for production credentials
- For local development, you can use `application-dev.properties` which can be excluded from git

### Using Environment Variables:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=${DB_URL}
spring.datasource.username=${DB_USERNAME}
spring.datasource.password=${DB_PASSWORD}
```

Then set these environment variables in your deployment environment or IDE configuration.

## Usage Instructions
The API can be accessed through multiple endpoints:

1. Local development: `http://localhost:8080`
2. EC2 example deployment: `http://[EC2-PUBLIC-IP]:80` - Replace `[EC2-PUBLIC-IP]` with your instance's public IPv4 address (found in your EC2 console)
3. Custom deployment: Configure your own endpoint as needed

### Database Access
- MySQL runs on port 3306 locally
- Default credentials are configured in docker-compose.yml
- For AWS deployments, use the RDS endpoint provided in your AWS console

## API Documentation
### Artists
- `GET /artists` - Retrieve all artists
- `GET /artist/{id}` - Get specific artist details
- `GET /artist_search` - Search artists by criteria
- `POST /artist` - Create a new artist
- `PUT /artist/{id}` - Update existing artist
- `DELETE /artist/{id}` - Remove an artist
### Albums
- `GET /albums` - Retrieve all albums
- `GET /album/{id}` - Get specific album details
- `GET /album_search` - Search albums by criteria
- `POST /album` - Create a new album
- `PUT /album/{id}` - Update existing album
- `DELETE /album/{id}` - Remove an album
### Songs
- `GET /songs` - Retrieve all songs
- `GET /song/{id}` - Get specific song details
- `GET /song_search` - Search songs by criteria
- `POST /song` - Create a new song
- `PUT /song/{id}` - Update existing song
- `DELETE /song/{id}` - Remove a song
## Testing with Postman
The API can be easily tested using Postman. A Postman collection file (`Tune-Tracker-API.postman_collection.json`) is provided in the project root, which includes:
- Pre-configured requests for all API endpoints
- Sample request bodies for POST and PUT operations
- Example test data for artists, albums, and songs
- Environment variables for easy configuration

To use the Postman collection:
1. Import the collection file into Postman
2. The collection includes a variable `baseUrl` with these options:
   - Local testing: Set to `http://localhost:8080`
   - EC2 deployment: Set to `http://[EC2-PUBLIC-IP]:80` (default in the provided collection)
   - Custom deployment: Update to your own URL as needed
3. Start testing the API endpoints with the provided examples

To change the base URL:
1. In Postman, go to the collection's variables
2. Update the `baseUrl` variable value
3. Save your changes
4. All requests will now use the new base URL
